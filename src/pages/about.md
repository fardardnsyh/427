Welcome to my personal space on the web. I'm Harrison, a software engineer by trade and a self-taught mathematician by passion, based in the vibrant city of Salt Lake City, Utah.

## Professional Path

With a keyboard at my fingertips, I transform complex problems into elegant solutions. My toolkit includes:

- **Rust**: Harnessing the power of SQLx for database interactions, Actix-Web for building powerful web applications, and Tokio for an asynchronous runtime.
- **JavaScript**: I create dynamic, interactive, and real-time web applications using React.js for the front end and Node.js for server-side magic.
- **PHP**: Scripting that brings web development to life, powering websites with efficient and robust back-end capabilities.
- **Python**: Utilizing the extensive list of libraries and tools that aid me in math.
- **PostgreSQL**: Where I store, manipulate, and retrieve data with finesse and precision, ensuring that data is not just data, but a treasure trove of insights.
- **And much more...**

## Hobbies & Interests

### Mathematics

A mathematician at heart, I am on a journey to rival the minds of career mathematicians with self-taught prowess. I delve into abstract concepts, seeking patterns and principles that underpin the very fabric of our universe.

## Goals

1. **Rust Excellence**: Aspiring to be recognized as one of the preeminent Rust developers in the world, striving for unmatched expertise and innovation.
2. **Mathematical Discovery**: Aspiring to join the ranks of world-class mathematicians, I am committed to making groundbreaking discoveries in the realm of pure mathematics.
3. **Entrepreneurship**: Sometime between now and the day I die, I plan on building my own business.
